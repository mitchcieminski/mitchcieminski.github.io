    <h2>About Mitch</h2>
    <p>Mitch Cieminski is a graduate student in the <a href="http://www.sts.rpi.edu/pl/phd-students-938">department of science and technology studies (STS) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>. Their current research examines the ways engineering students learn about and make sense of personal, professional, and social responsibility. They also examine the sociotechnical experiences of disabled, queer, and trans engineers. They graduated from Olin College of Engineering in December 2016 with a B.S. in electrical and computer engineering.</p>
