**Mitch Cieminski** is a graduate student in the [department of science and technology studies (STS) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://hass.rpi.edu/science-technology-studies). Their current research examines the experiences of disabled engineers and engineering students. They previously focused on the ways engineering students learn about and make sense of ethics and responsibility broadly speaking. Their work also has focused on the sociotechnical experiences of disabled, queer, and trans engineers. Mitch graduated from Olin College of Engineering in December 2016 with a B.S. in electrical and computer engineering and has an M.S. in Science and Technology Studies from RPI.

If you would like to learn more about or participate in Mitch's dissertation research project about disabled engineers, please check out the [scheduling](https://mitchcieminski.youcanbook.me/) page for the project. *Thank you!*
