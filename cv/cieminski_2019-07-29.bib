    abstract = {A key event in many engineering and design learning environments is the design review, in which students present project work to solicit feedback from reviewers like instructors, peers, and outside visitors. Previous research on design reviews demonstrates how feedback affects student growth and task achievement. However, there is limited research within engineering education that examines the relationship between feedback and other features of a design review. One such feature is the power dynamics between the student and the instructor, which may be germane to the review outcome. The purpose of this exploratory study is to investigate the extent to which the power dynamics within the design review are related to the design review feedback. Using previously-collected video recordings of design reviews in an undergraduate mechanical engineering design course and an undergraduate industrial design course, an in-depth exploration of two formative design reviews (one from each course) was conducted. Open coding methodologies were applied to examine power structures and to capture the critical incidents related to power dynamics, while existing classification schemes were used to identify the types of feedback that occur within and around these incidents. Some feedback types were found to be commonly used by instructors to disrupt design reviews. Furthermore, the findings suggest that students have a relatively restricted set of approaches to interact with the reviewers in design reviews, and that, even in more-equitable reviews, students can have limited effect in achieving their discursive goals. Overall, the results of this exploratory research study can be used to provide educators with an increased awareness of the relationships among feedback, power dynamics, and project contexts and to support future research about power dynamics within design learning environments.},

				    abstract = {This paper explores how engineering students understand and experience the meaning and role of ethics within their own life experiences, the context of their education, and their projections of professional practice. The project takes a distinctly empirical approach to engineering ethics, seeking to identify what is most salient about ethics and ethics education from the perspective of the students we interviewed, in micro- and macroethical levels across the personal, social, and professional dimensions. Through interviews and observation of ethics-related institutional activities, we connect student experiences and knowledge of ethics applied in diverse areas of students? education. We find that many students interviewed perceive deficiencies in their understandings of ethics, have a desire to discuss their ethics-related experiences, use negative frames such as harm or disaster avoidance to consider engineering ethics, and value trust and security in the educational environment as an important part of improved ethical outcomes. We identify a few implications of these themes for engineering ethics researchers and instructors: that ethics should be treated explicitly and regularly across engineering education, that ethics discourses should be disentangled from perceptions of moralizing, and that ethics reform efforts ought to be attuned to educational cultures, not just individual knowledge or capacities.},

				    abstract = {This pilot study presents a potentially novel way to consider gender and sexual diversity in STEM by attempting to identify sociotechnical practices which might be considered “queer” in a broad sense—by being of, by, for, or regarding queer people—and by seeking to understand how these practices might challenge and complement other technical practice and education. To explore these questions, I conducted participant-observation fieldwork at a student-run theater organization at a mid-sized technical university, identified by students as “outstandingly queer” for both its increased proportion of LGBTQ+ students and its notably welcoming attitude toward them. From examining student-run practices across technical theater, acting, directing, and organizational management, I find that the practices of identity negotiation, performance, and flexible democratic decision-making, situated in an alternative technical-social space, are sociotechnical practices with a queer inflection important to the site. These can help engineering educators in three ways: 1) by simply providing a description of some meaningful sociotechnical experiences of queer students; 2) by beginning to bridge the “diversity-oriented” and “technically oriented” streams in engineering education research through considering how queer STEM students are innovative technologists in their own right; and 3) by contributing to the body of useful cases for potential changes to the sociotechnical environment of engineering education. This paper presents these practices, as well as the role of in/authenticity, as some salient aspects of queer student experience as I observed it.},
