My personal website/blog

I am updating this website yet again, 2022-05-24.

This website runs on Jekyll. To run jekyll on your own machine, you can follow the [instructions on the jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), and then run the command `bundle` from within the repository. Then you can build the project using `bundle exec jekyll build` and `bundle exec jekyll serve`. You may run into issues with `bundler`, in which case, run `bundle update --bundler`.
